  epsonscan2 - Simple Image Acquisition

  Copyright (C) 2018  SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION

Please read out the license and Privacy Statement(http://download.ebz.epson.net/ps/linux/).

  SUMMARY
  =======
    This software provides applications to easily turn hard-copy
    documents and imagery into formats that are more amenable to
    computer processing.

    Included are a native driver for a number of EPSON scanners
    and a compatibility driver to interface with software built
    around the SANE standard.


  LICENSING
  =========
    This software is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
    Public License, version 2.1 or at your option any later version.
    A copy of this license can be found in the 'COPYING' file.


USING THE SOFTWARE
==================
  The software can be started from a command-line with the `epsonscan2`
  command.  This will automatically select a suitable application to
  control image acquisition and select the default device.  The GUI
  supports selecting a different device should you want to.

  In case you installed from a binary package, chances are that the
  binary package maintainer integrated the software in the desktop
  menu system.  If so, you can probably start up the GUI from there.

  NETWORK SUPPORT
  ---------------
    Most, if not all, of the above devices can be used via a network
    connection.  If you want to do so with this software, install the
    non-free-plugin package.  This plugin is available via the
    EPSON Download Center[1].

  REQUIRED SOFTWARE
  -----------------
    In order to be able to build all components and test (and do so in
    a variety of configurations) a large number of developer oriented
    software packages are needed.
    To make getting all that software on your system a bit easier, the
    sources include a script to install all these packages for you (install-deps).
